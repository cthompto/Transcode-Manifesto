The Transcode Manifesto, is a framework for understanding and producing work from a trans perspective. As a living document, the Transcode Manifesto, informs and is informed by my studio practice. Investing in the possibilities posed by the theoretical combination of trans and code, the Transcode Manifesto explores how these ideas can be leveraged within a transdisciplinary art practice.
Transcode work at its core refuses a linear understanding of narrative, time, knowledge making, and labor. Instead, transcode work insists upon lingering in the ebb and flow between categories, definitions, and destinations, to see the many iterations and tangents of a work as inseparable from its final product and inscrutable to the logic of cause and effect. How might an ending have affected its own beginning? 
Transcode examines code as a base material in culture’s generation of meaning and narrative. Code meaning: “a system of signals or symbols for communication,” as well as “a system of principles,” and “instructions for a computer.” Transcode then, is an interruption of and traversal between codes. An effort in placing oneself at the site/sight/cite of meaning making, exposing the codes (structures, processes, laws) which undergird supposedly inherent truths (of gender, of ownership, of land).
